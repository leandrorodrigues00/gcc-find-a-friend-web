## 👩‍💻 About the project

The Green Chain Challenge is a project developed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) for the community, with challenges that simulate real situations that you, the developer, will find in the job market!

The "Find a Friend" project was created to streamline the pet adoption process. The platform allows users to locate dogs and cats available for adoption within their city, while providing customizable search filters based on preferred age, energy level, independence and size.
In addition, it also includes a dedicated section for animal welfare organizations to register their pets for adoption.
